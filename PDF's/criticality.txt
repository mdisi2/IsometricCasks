The staff reviewed the HI-STORM 100 Cask System criticality analysis to ensure that all
credible normal, off-normal, and accident conditions have been identified and their potential
consequences on criticality considered such that the HI-STORM 100 Cask System meets the
following regulatory requirements: 10 CFR 72.24(c)(3), 72.24(d), 72.124, 72.236(c), and
72.236(g). The SAR was also reviewed to determine whether the cask system fulfills the
following acceptance criteria listed in Section 6 of NUREG-1536, Standard Review Plan for Dry
Cask Storage Systems:
5. The multiplication factor, including all biases and uncertainties at a 95 percent confidence
level, should not exceed 0.95 under all credible normal, off-normal, and accident
conditions.
6. At least two unlikely, independent, and concurrent or sequential changes to the conditions
essential to criticality safety, under normal, off-normal, and accident conditions, should
occur before an accidental criticality is deemed to be possible.
7. When practicable, criticality safety of the design should be established on the basis of
favorable geometry, permanent fixed neutron-absorbing materials (poisons), or both.
Where solid neutron-absorbing materials are used, the design should provide for a
positive means to verify their continued efficacy during the storage period.
4. Criticality safety of the cask system should not rely on use of the following credits:
a. burnup of the fuel
b. fuel-related burnable neutron absorbers
3. more than 75 percent for fixed neutron absorbers when subject to standard
acceptance tests.
